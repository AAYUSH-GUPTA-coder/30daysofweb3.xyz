## üëã Welcome to 30 Days of Web3!

If you're reading this, you're here to build dope dapps ‚Äî Welcome! A quick intro on ourselves ‚Äî we're a global collective of top emerging talent. From over 10 countries, we developed this curriculum as we tried different solutions to build dapps, and we're sharing what we found to be a good starting point for any dapp.

As you start going through the curriculum, you may notice some differences that the team has not caught or updated. This technology is very nascent, and things are changing almost daily.

If you see anything that should be updated, we kindly ask that you open PRs for errors you can correct or report issues. The repo is [here](https://github.com/womenbuildweb3/30daysofweb3.xyz).

## üëæ Launchpad Server

We have a dedicated Discord server where we hang out, host office hours, make important announcements, raffle prizes, and more. Join the server to meet other builders, learn from each other, and ship projects together! To access our Launchpad server, kindly register via [this form](https://forms.gle/SdwSP3BzsnVcXtjP9).

## üåê BUIDL Accelerator

After 30 Days of Web3, we'll be supporting 3-8 projects with grants of $3-$30K. These could be ideas that come as you go through 30 Days of Web3, and you can build a team with others to bring an idea to life.

Those who did not participate in 30 Days of Web3 can still apply for the accelerator by submitting a past project to be considered. More details will be available soon. Keep an eye on the **#announcements** channel in our Launchpad server.

## üíª Tech Check

This course is for people who want to start building on Ethereum. If you don't know how to code, _don't worry._ Rather than focus on teaching the implementation, we'll walk you through the code and help you understand how the different protocols communicate with each other.

This course will focus on big-picture architecture and will help you define the web3 tech stack you'll be able to use to build any idea you have- and apply that idea to BUIDL Accelerator.

Nice to have:

- Basic understanding of how to navigate your terminal
- Basic JavaScript
- Basic React

It's helpful to be familiar with the aforementioned, but you'll pick up everything along the way.

## üöÄ Before Starting

This course is fully async, online, and created to only take 30-45 mins daily to ship in 30 days. The curriculum is paced, and you'll notice notes indicating the end of days 1, 2, 3, etc. These markers are paced with some buffer, so if you're off by a day or two, don't sweat it. If you're not planning to apply for the BUIDL Accelerator, you can feel free to go through this project at your own pace and ignore the pace markers.

To be eligible to apply to the BUIDL Accelerator, you must finish this course within the next **40 days** to meet the application deadline. More details on the BUIDL Accelerator will be released soon.

## üëÄ Project Overview

You'll be building an event management and creation dapp from beginning to end. You'll learn how to build with this stack on Ethereum:

- Filecoin & IPFS
- The Graph
- Radicle
- Infura
- Polygon
- Lens

Check out a video of the dapp we're going to build [here](https://www.loom.com/share/c3fb24a579644feaa7510e98be37181a).

Below is a diagram of the dapp architecture.

## üê• Share Your Progress

We built this with a lot of love **for you.** Let us know how it's going by following the prompts to tweet as you go through the course. These tweets will allow us to gauge participation and reward those who are active. We are raffling off fun prizes like Surge Women NFTs, ENS names, and more. By tweeting about the course using #30DaysOfWeb3 and tagging @womenbuildweb3, you'll automatically be entered into the raffle. 1 tweet = 1 entry --> if you make many tweets, you'll get many entries. Happy tweeting üê•

## üèÅ Checkpoints

Throughout the course, there'll be checkpoints for you to test what you've learned and earn unique [kudos](https://mintkudos.xyz/), peer-verified non-transferable tokens.

These checkpoints are **required** to apply to the BUIDL Accelerator. If you're not planning to apply for the BUIDL Accelerator, feel free to skip the checkpoints.

## üóì Workshops

Mark your calendars to attend live workshops! These workshops will supplement the curriculum and give you opportunities to learn from experienced web3 devs and ask questions live. Stay tuned to the **#events-and-workshops** channel for workshop details.

You can also add the official 30 Days of Web3 events calendar to your Google Calendar by following [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y18xdDVjOTIxZW1qOTViazQyNWhuOHFhYmdkZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).

Head over to the **#workshop-qna** channel to ask questions you want the workshop host to answer - these could be personal, about tech, and anything in between. Throw a üëçüèº on questions you'd like to see answered, and the top questions will be answered during the workshop.

Recordings of the workshops will be posted in the **#workshop-recordings** channel.

## ü§ö Getting Help

When you have a question, drop a message on the Discord server in the channel that corresponds to the section you're in.

This project is broken up into 9 sections, and you'll see a help channel for each section where a member of the WBW3 team will help you out.

There will also be office hours during which you can ask questions, pair program, and co-work with others. Office hours will be added to the **#events-and-workshops** channel, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled there.

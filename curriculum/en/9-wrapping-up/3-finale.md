The importance of Web3 can not be stressed enough. Securing information, non-fungible tokens, artist royalties, and voting processes are all proven areas that web3 has been able to transform how people can organize in a decentralized world.

In this course you learned about some of the most game-changing Web3 protocols that will give you the tools as a developer to create the next transformational protocol.

You can deploy your dApps on Polygon, which provides faster and cheaper transactions with less network congestion. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol will help you in storing, sharing, and retrieving data for your dApps.

You can use Ethers.js to interact with dApps with the blockchain ecosystem from your frontend applications. The Graph protocol will allow querying data from smart contracts via GraphQL APIs.

Finally you can host your code on Radicle, which allows storing git repositories for code collaboration that is free from censorship.

Donâ€™t forget to tweet and share your progress. You really just built a full stack web3 dApp!

Now itâ€™s time to get out there and keep building! ðŸ’ª
